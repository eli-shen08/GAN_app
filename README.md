# GAN_app
 My first GAN application trained on cifar_10

 # About Project
This is a small project that i have created where i have created and trained a GAN model .
The model was trained on 25,000 images from the cifar_10 dataset .
By no means are the generated images good but sometimes they do resemble something .
This model was trained on google colab t4 Gpu for 2 hours approximately .
It trained for 180 epochs , each epoch had 195 batch size .
